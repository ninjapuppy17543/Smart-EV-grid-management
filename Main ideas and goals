Physical model:
  1. The idea is to have a PCB board control LED that represent Electric Vehicles (Electric Vehicles - Buses and personal cars), the different colours represent statutes of the EV's
  2. It will be a vertical board with cut outs for led and screens, the goal is to make it interectable with the user and visualise for the viewer it very well


Simulation/coding:
  1. Distribution algorithm?


Main goals:
  1. Make a mathematical algorithm that makes EV charging much more efficient
  2. Motto: Make EV charging cheaper and more sustainable 


Programming goals:
 1. Seperate the windows so it's easier to see (test it out, see if it looks any better)
 2. Make a power grid simulator, that take into consideration the costs of activating powerplants and the such
 3. Make the price fluctuate based on supply and demand, using the real world formula

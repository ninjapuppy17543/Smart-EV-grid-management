Physical model:
  1. The idea is to have a PCB board control LED that represent Electric Vehicles (Electric Vehicles - Buses and personal cars), the different colours represent statutes of the EV's
  2. It will be a vertical board with cut outs for led and screens, the goal is to make it interectable with the user and visualise for the viewer it very well
Simulation/coding:
  1. Distribution algorithm?
Main goals:
  1. Make a mathematical algorithm that makes EV charging much more efficient
  2. Motto: Make EV charging cheaper and more sustainable
